# Lab 2. Python crash course

## Pre-lab Questions

## Programming with git!

We will actively use git in our labs. 

Today, we will make full use of **1 PC + 1 RPI** setup in room 326.
As shown in the following figure, your will write and test your python code on the desktop. After you're sure that code is ready to be run on RPI, you will get it and run it on RPI.

1. Make a repository on github.com that you want to share with your teammate.

2. Work on PC
   * Clone the repository to the desktop.
   * Add a python code.
   * Commit your work and push it to the repository.
        
3. Test on RPI
    * First of all, you need to install git.
    
        ```
        sudo apt install git
        ```
        
    * Clone the repository to your RPI.
    
        ```
        git clone [ADDRESS-OF-YOUR-REPOSITORY]
        ```
        
    * Run and make any change you want.
    
    * To submit changes you made to the repository,
    
        ```
        git commit [ANY CHANGE YOU MADE]
        ```

        ```
        git push
        ```
